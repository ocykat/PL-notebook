# Chapter 3: Functions

There are different ways to create functions in JS:

## Method 1

This method is called function expression.

```js
function foo(a, b, c) {
    // do something
}
```

## Method 2

This method is called function declaration.

```js
var foo = function(a, b, c) {
    // do something
}
```
