#+TITLE: Python Virtual Environment - The Right Way

Most Python beginners would learn how to use =virtualenv= and stick to it (I did myself). However, in the newer versions of Python, it is recommended to use =venv= instead. Especially, if you are using Debian-based Linux distros such as Ubuntu, since version 18.04, =virtualenv= cannot be installed so easily.

To install =venv=:

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo apt install python3-venv
#+END_SRC

To use =venv=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 -m venv <project-name>
# activate
source <project-name>/bin/activate
# deactivate
deactivate
#+END_SRC
