# Dart Programming Language

## How to use this note

Each section has a rating (according to my POV):
* 1 star [*]: the section is basic, and should be important for a new learner
* 2 stars [**]: the section either discuss mentions some immediate features of the language that a fluent Dart programmer should know
* 3 stars [***]: the section is somewhat advanced, dealing with topics such as advanced syntaxes, built-in data structures, performance enhancement, etc.
