# Chapter 01. Introduction to the C++ Language


## Brief History

The C programming language was created in 1972. C is a general-purpose, **high-level programming language** that also offers **low-level operations**, which makes it super versatile. C is one of the most influential languages in the history. UNIX, the predecessor of every operating system (except Windows), was written in C. Lots of later programming languages based their syntax on the syntax of C, creating a group of languages known as the C-family languages: C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, Javascripts, Perl, php, etc.

One particular problem with C is that it does not offers the **object-oriented programming paradigm**. C++ was created for that purpose in the 80s.

Bonus: Why was Java invented? One particular problem with C or C++, or any programming languages at the time is creating cross-platform software. If a programmer wants to run a program on two different operating systems, he or she must compile the C/C++ code with two different compilers, each targeting only one operating system. If the programmer wants to target n different platforms, there needs to be n different compilers and the code must be compiled n times.


## What is C++ used for?

C++ is a general-purpose language, which means it can do pretty much everything. However, these days C++ are mostly used for:
* Operating systems
* High-performance software
* Systems with limited resources such as microcontrollers.

*In general, if you want something **fast** and **efficient**, go for C++. Otherwise, most of the time you should use something else.*


## C++ is a compiled language

C++ is a compiled language, which means a program written in C++ code must be compiled into machine code before it can run. This is different from interpreted languages such as Python, where the code can run directly without compiling thanks to a program called **interpreter**. The program which compiles C++ code into machine code is called the **compiler**.

The next chapter introduces different C++ compilers, as well as development tools for the language.
